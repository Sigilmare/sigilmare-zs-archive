# COPYRIGHT NOTICE
The cl_skillweb.lua file was granted permission to be used by Scott for this server when it was active.
Contents in that file belong to the Sunrust community, our edits are obviously not included. But without that original code, we couldn't have modified it.
If you use any code from that file that belongs to the Sunrust community, you more than likely will get into trouble for stealing code.
Note that our weapons also use viewmodels from Sunrust, but you do not have direct access to those model files.
All workshop content packs were deleted 1-2 weeks ago at the time of writing this (15/11/23) so I no longer have those assets.
You have been warned. Use the publicly available one on JetBoom's github.
